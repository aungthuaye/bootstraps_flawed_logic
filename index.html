      <h1>By the Bootstraps.</h1> 
      <h2>What an idiotic concept. </h2>
      <p>Day one, January 24, 2022:</p>
      <p>As though one can simply walk out and decide one day to completely change their entire life. As though it's as easy as *POOF* (waves wand, puff of smoke) and tada! New life!
      </p>
      <p>Yes, it is as dumb as it sounds. </p>
      <p>As though the only supplies necessary in life are a good pair of workboots. 
      </p>
      <p>I had a great pair of workboots, the best $37 I had spent on footwear in a very long time, Lugs. (Yes, I know, and don’t care). They were repossessed with my car, over one late payment. 
One.</p>
      <p>When we agreed to pay the late payment 3 hours after taking our car, they could not pinpoint where our car was. It was lost for 2 weeks before anyone revealed to use where it had been taken and had racked up lot fees, which, because we had paid the payment the same day it was taken, and they misplaced our car, they were responsible for. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>They tried to charge us $1200 in storage fees,</strong> which we brought to the attention of the finance company that had it repoed. They didn't want to pay it either. Meanwhile, I talk to someone in the office for the repo company.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Turns out they had completely ripped apart the suspension on the car when they yanked it out of our driveway.</strong> This was the first they had told us about this.   My husband and I decided to take the loss and let them auction it. 
      </p>
      <p>They have yet to contact us about all of this… I assume there is something coming from it but it has yet to hit.
      </p>
      <h3>But “pull yourself up by your bootstraps.”</h3>
      <P>Well, I don't have bootstraps, but what I do have is kneehigh pirate boots, a whole lot more ambition than I have the right to possess, a reading speed of 447 words per minute with 100% comprehension, and a whole lot of free learning opportunities at my fingertips, thanks to the great plague of 2020-? (it now being January 2022).
      </P>
      <p>So, I decided… that’s exactly what I am going to do.  I am going to learn an entirely new skill set.  
      </p>
      <p>Since I was 13 years old, I have been working in restaurants, in offices, in retail, and in management across the board. I have been a part of the working world for 22 years. I have gotten to witness firsthand the enormous shift in the social contract that most retail and restaurant workers have seen. 
      </p>
      <p>Service industry employees have gone from persons able to afford a college education to barely keeping their heads above water. From the helpful staff to essentially serfs in a matter of just 20 years' time. So, I am going to intentionally try to flip the dynamic.  
      </p>
      <p>20 years' time. So, I am going to intentionally try to flip the dynamic.  I am learning a new job skill set. Something I have never considered before, I am going to learn and master it and become more in demand than ever, and be able to demand whatever from my employer, or, simply begin working for me, That part is yet undecided, and we will work through together.
      </p>
      <p>People have laughed at me my entire life for being different, for standing out, for being ill, for being their version of weak. 
      </p>
      <p>I literally live on borrowed time every day. They fail to realize this is why things don't scare me. I had accepted death as an inevitability at 3 years old. Once you respect death, you are able to walk hand in hand with him through the years and laugh like old friends.  
      </p>
      <p>And if you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans. 
      </p>
      <p>I am going to completely change my life and the lives of my family. I am going to change the lives of those in the bottom rungs of society.  
      </p>
      <p>I do not care who laughs. 
      </p>
      <p>They see not the vision I have, know not the ambition I possess. It is but a matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>I am going to do it in my own authentic way, and if you glorious humans want to come along for the ride, so be it.
      </p>
